The dataset consists of three CSV files that were moved into a single Excel workbook to facilitate the necessary queries. 
In the project workbook the steps taken for the data processing phase were the following:

1. removing unnecessary columns for this project: `Coffee type` and `Totals`
2. unpivoting each dataset, creating a single `Year` column
3. merging of the three dataset into one comprehensive dataset for analysis.

None of the three dataset presented any Null or inconsistent values
